<i> Multi-Omics Analysis Tool</i> is a computational method for discovering the principal sources of variation in multi‚Äêomics data sets.

Methods for the integrative analysis of multi-omics data are required to draw a more complete and accurate picture of the dynamics of molecular systems. The complexity of biological systems, the technological limits, the large number of biological variables and the relatively low number of biological samples make the analysis of multi-omics datasets a non-trivial problem.

From the left navigation panel you'll be able to access the machine learning model, and visualization.
